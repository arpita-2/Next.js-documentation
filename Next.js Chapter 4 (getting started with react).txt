Notes=================================================================================

1) react is the core React library.
   react-dom provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM.

===Create root = we use create root to create a React root for displaying content inside a browser DOM element.
===Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live 
   together in the same place—components.
===React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic 
   information. 
===JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.

2) What is JSX?/
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing
about JSX is that apart from following three JSX rules, you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML 
and JavaScript.

===3 rules of JSX
==a) Return a single root element 
->-> To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag. Here <div> is the parent tag.
     eg: 
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>


If you don’t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead:
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>

so basically, This empty tag <> is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.


===b) Close all the tags
->->-> JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as 
<li>oranges</li>.

<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>

===c) Camel case all most of the things
      Javascript has its own limitations on variable names-their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG 
      attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of stroke-width you use strokeWidth.Since class is a reserved word, in React you write className instead.


3) ClassName property/=
->-> The name className is used for this property instead of class because of conflicts with the "class" keyword in many languages which are used to manipulate the DOM.

4)Babel: 

babel is a javaScript compiler.....browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a Babel.

5) Conditional (ternary operator)
