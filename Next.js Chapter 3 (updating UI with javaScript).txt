1)  HTML represents the initial page content, whereas the DOM represents the updated page content which was changed by the 
JavaScript code you wrote.

##Imperative vs Declarative programming
Imperative programming: so in imperatve programming we have to write the all the DOM method step by step. This lead to slow down the process.
imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. 

Declarative programming: A declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process.
Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

React is a declarative library. As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update 
the DOM on your behalf.
