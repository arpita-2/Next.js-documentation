Next js ..................Chapter 1

Notes:

1) Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast, full-stack web applications.
   can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all 
   while improving the developer and end-user experience.

2) There are few things that we need to know about while building the web applications:
   a) user interface: how users will consume and interact with your application.
   b) Rendering:      when and where you render static or dynamic content.
   c) Data fetching:  where your data lives and how to get it.
   d) Infrastructure: where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
   e) Integration:    what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
   f) Routing:        how users navigate between different parts of your application.
   g) performance:    how to optimize your application for end-users.
   h) scalability:    how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
   i) Developer experience: your team's experience building and maintaining your application.


3) React: React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

4) What do you mean by library in react?/
Ans: So basically library mean the react provide API to build UI to the developer but it's depend on the developer where to use those functions in the application

5) What do you mean by framework in Next.js ?/
Ans: By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your 
     application.
